			<header>1.Whetting Your Appetite</header>
			<p>If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. For example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.</p>

			<p>If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library and find writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your application.</p>

			<p><strong>Python is just the language for you.</strong></p>

			<p>You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving around files and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could write a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a first-draft program. Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done more quickly.</p>

			<p>Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.</p>

			<p>Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs — or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.</p>

			<p>Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.</p>

			<p>Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:

    		<ul><li>the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</li>
    		<li>statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</li>
    		<li>no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li></ul>

			<p>Python is extensible: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific graphics library). Once you are really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an extension or command language for that application.</p>

			<p>By the way, the language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and has nothing to do with reptiles. Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged!</p>

			<p>Now that you are all excited about Python, you’ll want to examine it in some more detail. Since the best way to learn a language is to use it, the tutorial invites you to play with the Python interpreter as you read.</p>

			<p>In the next chapter, the mechanics of using the interpreter are explained. This is rather mundane information, but essential for trying out the examples shown later.</p>

			<p>The rest of the tutorial introduces various features of the Python language and system through examples, beginning with simple expressions, statements and data types, through functions and modules, and finally touching upon advanced concepts like exceptions and user-defined classes.</p>

			<header>2.Using the Python Interpreter</header>
			<p class="subhead" id="Invoking_the_Interpreter">2.1. Invoking the Interpreter</p>

			<p>The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.7 on those machines where it is available; putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:</p>

			<code id="f1a">python3.7</code>
			<p>to the shell. [<a href="#f1">1</a>] Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option, other places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g., /usr/local/python is a popular alternative location.)</p>

			<p>On Windows machines, the Python installation is usually placed in C:\Python37, though you can change this when you’re running the installer. To add this directory to your path, you can type the following command into the command prompt in a DOS box:</p>

			<code>set path=%path%;C:\python37</code>

			<p>Typing an end-of-file character (Control-D on Unix, Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter by typing the following command: <code>quit().</code></p>

			<p>The interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion on systems that support readline. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line editing is supported is typing Control-P to the first Python prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command line editing; see Appendix Interactive Input Editing and History Substitution for an introduction to the keys. If nothing appears to happen, or if ^P is echoed, command line editing isn’t available; you’ll only be able to use backspace to remove characters from the current line.</p>

			<p>The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a script from that file.</p>

			<p>A second way of starting the interpreter is python -c command [arg] ..., which executes the statement(s) in command, analogous to the shell’s -c option. Since Python statements often contain spaces or other characters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote command in its entirety with single quotes.</p>

			<p>Some Python modules are also useful as scripts. These can be invoked using python -m module [arg] ..., which executes the source file for module as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line.</p>

			<p>When a script file is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run the script and enter interactive mode afterwards. This can be done by passing -i before the script.</p>

			<p>All command line options are described in Command line and environment.</p>
			<p class="subhead" id="Argument_Passing">2.1.1. Argument Passing</p>

			<p>When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the argv variable in the sys module. You can access this list by executing import sys. The length of the list is at least one; when no script and no arguments are given, sys.argv[0] is an empty string. When the script name is given as '-' (meaning standard input), sys.argv[0] is set to '-'. When -c command is used, sys.argv[0] is set to '-c'. When -m module is used, sys.argv[0] is set to the full name of the located module. Options found after -c command or -m module are not consumed by the Python interpreter’s option processing but left in sys.argv for the command or module to handle.</p>
			<p class="subhead" id="Interactive_Mode">2.1.2. Interactive Mode</p>

			<p>When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in interactive mode. In this mode it prompts for the next command with the primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (>>>); for continuation lines it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default three dots (...). The interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the first prompt:</p>

			<code>$ python3.7
			Python 3.7 (default, Sep 16 2015, 09:25:04)
			[GCC 4.8.2] on linux
			Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
			>>></code>

			<p>Continuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct. As an example, take a look at this if statement:</p>
			<code>
			>>> the_world_is_flat = True
			>>> if the_world_is_flat:
			...     print("Be careful not to fall off!")
			...
			Be careful not to fall off!</code>

			<p>For more on interactive mode, see Interactive Mode.</p>
			<p class="subhead" id="The_Interpreter_and_Its_Environment">2.2. The Interpreter and Its Environment</p>
			<p class="subhead" id="Source_Code_Encoding">2.2.1. Source Code Encoding</p>

			<p>By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. In that encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments — although the standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable code should follow. To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the file.</p>

			<p>To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as the first line of the file. The syntax is as follows:</p>

			<code># -*- coding: encoding -*-</code>

			<p>where encoding is one of the valid codecs supported by Python.</p>

			<p>For example, to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the first line of your source code file should be:</p>

			<code># -*- coding: cp1252 -*-</code>

			<p>One exception to the first line rule is when the source code starts with a UNIX “shebang” line. In this case, the encoding declaration should be added as the second line of the file. For example:</p>

			<code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
			# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-</code>

			Footnotes
			<p id="f1">[<a href="#f1a">1</a>]	On Unix, the Python 3.x interpreter is by default not installed with the executable named python, so that it does not conflict with a simultaneously installed Python 2.x executable.</p>

			<header>3.An Informal Introduction to Python</header>
			
			<p>In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts</p> 
			<code>(>>> and …):</code> <p>to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.</p>

			<p>Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.</p>

			<p>Some examples:</p>

			<code># this is the first comment
			spam = 1  # and this is the second comment
			          # ... and now a third!
			text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."</code>

			<p>Let’s try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and wait for the primary prompt, >>>. (It shouldn’t take long.)</p>
